            1. What are the differences between Local Storage & Session Storage?
        </h3>
        <p>
            <span class="fw-bold">Ans:</span> <br>
            <span class="fw-bold">Local Storage:</span>
            Web storage can be viewed simplistically as an improvement on cookies, providing much greater storage
            capacity. Available size is 5MB which considerably more space to work with than a typical 4KB cookie.
            The data is not sent back to the server for every HTTP request (HTML, images, JavaScript, CSS, etc) -
            reducing the amount of traffic between client and server.
            The data stored in localStorage persists until explicitly deleted. Changes made are saved and available for
            all current and future visits to the site. <br>
            <span class="fw-bold">Session Storage:</span>
            It is similar to localStorage.
            Changes are only available per window (or tab in browsers like Chrome and Firefox). Changes made are saved
            and available for the current page, as well as future visits to the site on the same window. Once the window
            is closed, the storage is deleted
            The data is available only inside the window/tab in which it was set.

        <h3>2. What are the differences between global scope & block scope?</h3>
        <p>
            <span class="fw-bold">
                Ans:
            </span> <br>
            Local scope is also known as block scope. A block is the code found inside a set of curly braces {}. Inside
            those curly braces we typically write out the business logic for our functions, statements and so on.
            So we think about scope in relation to blocks or local and global scope because variables can exist either
            outside or within these blocks or the local scope. <br>
            In global scope, variables are declared outside of blocks or outside the local scope. These variables are
            called global variables. Because global variables are not bound inside a block, they can be accessed by any
            code in the program, including code in blocks.
