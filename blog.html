            1. What are the differences between Local Storage & Session Storage?
        </h3>
        <p>
            <span class="fw-bold">Ans:</span> <br>
            <span class="fw-bold">Local Storage:</span>
            Web storage can be viewed simplistically as an improvement on cookies, providing much greater storage
            capacity. Available size is 5MB which considerably more space to work with than a typical 4KB cookie.
            The data is not sent back to the server for every HTTP request (HTML, images, JavaScript, CSS, etc) -
            reducing the amount of traffic between client and server.
            The data stored in localStorage persists until explicitly deleted. Changes made are saved and available for
            all current and future visits to the site. <br>
            <span class="fw-bold">Session Storage:</span>
            It is similar to localStorage.
            Changes are only available per window (or tab in browsers like Chrome and Firefox). Changes made are saved
            and available for the current page, as well as future visits to the site on the same window. Once the window
            is closed, the storage is deleted
            The data is available only inside the window/tab in which it was set.

        <h3>2. What are the differences between global scope & block scope?</h3>
        <p>
            <span class="fw-bold">
                Ans:
            </span> <br>
            Local scope is also known as block scope. A block is the code found inside a set of curly braces {}. Inside
            those curly braces we typically write out the business logic for our functions, statements and so on.
            So we think about scope in relation to blocks or local and global scope because variables can exist either
            outside or within these blocks or the local scope. <br>
            In global scope, variables are declared outside of blocks or outside the local scope. These variables are
            called global variables. Because global variables are not bound inside a block, they can be accessed by any
            code in the program, including code in blocks.

        <h3>3. How does JS eventloop work?</h3>
        <p>
            <span class="fw-bold">Ans.</span> <br> JavaScript is an high level,
            interpreted, single threaded non-blocking, asynchronous, concurrent
            language.
            <br />
            <span class="fw-bold">Single thread</span>
            <br />
            A thread of execution is the smallest sequence of programmed
            instruction that can be managed independently by a scheduler. A
            programming language is single-threaded means it can only perform one
            task or operation at a single time. This means it would execute an
            entire process from start to end without the thread being interrupted
            or stopped. Unlike multi-threaded languages where multiple processes
            can be run on several threads concurrently without blocking each
            other.
            <br />
            <span class="fw-bold">Non-blocking</span>
            <br />
            There is no one definition of blocking; it just simply means things
            that are running slowly on the thread. So non-blocking means things
            that aren't slow on the thread.
            <br />
            <span class="fw-bold">Concurrent</span>
            <br />
            Concurrency means that the code is being executed concurrently by more
            than one thread.
            <br />
            <span class="fw-bold">Asynchronous</span>
            <br />
            Asynchronous programming means that the code runs in an event loop.
            When there is a blocking operation, the event is started. The blocking
            code keeps running without blocking the main execution thread. When
            the blocking code finishes running, it queue's the result of the
            blocking operations and pushes them back to the stack.
            <br />
            <span class="fw-bold">Conclusion</span>
            <br />
            While this is a very basic introduction, the concept of asynchronous
            programming in JavaScript gives enough insight to clearly understand
            what is going on under the hood and how JavaScript is able to run
            concurrently and asynchronously with just a single thread.
